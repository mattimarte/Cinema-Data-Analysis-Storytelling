# Cinema Data Analysis: A Narrative Journey through Film History

## Project Overview
This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** performed on a massive dataset containing information about the cinema industry, including movie titles, cast & crew details, box office records, and prestigious awards.

The goal was not just to process numbers, but to uncover the "story" hidden within the data—identifying patterns, industry shifts, and success factors over the decades.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries:** 
    * **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
    * **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
    * **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For data visualization and storytelling.

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled large `.csv` files, managed missing values, and standardized inconsistent data formats (e.g., date formats, currency normalization).
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Investigated correlations between genres, production countries and ratings, the evolution of genres over time, and the "power" of specific types of cinema.
3. **Data Storytelling:** Created a visual narrative to explain key findings, making complex data accessible and insightful.
